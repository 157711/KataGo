The code in this repository currently relies on three other libraries, sgfmill, tclap-1.2.1, and zstr. For the licenses for those libraries, see the readme and/or license files for those libraries separately within their respective subdirectories. Additionally, cpp/core/sha2.cpp derives from another piece of external code and contains its own license.

Aside from the above, the license for all other content in this repo is as follows:

License aside, informally, if do you successfully use any of the code or any wacky ideas about neural net structure explored in this repo in your own neural nets or to run any of your own experiments, I would to love hear about it and/or might also appreciate a casual acknowledgement where appropriate.
